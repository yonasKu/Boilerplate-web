# ðŸŽ¯ Trial Status Integration - Complete

## âœ… Trial Data Added to Signup

### **Updated User Structure in Firestore:**
```typescript
// When user signs up, this is saved to Firestore:
{
  email: "user@example.com",
  displayName: "John Doe", 
  emailVerified: false,
  createdAt: timestamp,
  source: "web",
  subscription: {
    status: "trial",
    trialEndDate: "2024-08-10T20:47:32.000Z", // 7 days from signup
    plan: "trial", 
    isActive: true
  }
  // Mobile app calculates trial days remaining dynamically from trialEndDate
}
```

### **What This Matches:**
- âœ… **Same structure as mobile app**
- âœ… **7-day trial period** (matches mobile)
- âœ… **Trial status tracking** for backend
- âœ… **Subscription data** ready for Stripe integration later

### **Complete Signup Flow with Trial:**
```
User signs up â†’ Account created â†’ Trial started (7 days) â†’ Email verification â†’ Download app â†’ Same trial continues in mobile app
```

### **Files Updated:**
- âœ… `src/hooks/useAuth.ts` - Added essential trial data only

### **Ready for Mobile Sync:**
When users download the mobile app and login:
- Same Firebase credentials work
- Same trial period continues
- Same subscription status
- Seamless transition from web to mobile

## ðŸŽ‰ Complete Implementation
The web signup now fully matches the mobile app's trial behavior!
